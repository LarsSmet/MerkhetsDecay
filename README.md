# Introduction
Merkhet's Decay is a zombie slasher based in Ancient Egypt. Where you play as the half-god Merkhet, armed with the power of time manipulation he fights against hordes whilst the infection slowly spreads over his body.

I made this project with Ruben Verhelst, one of my best friends. My primary focus was on designing and prototyping, while he took charge of the blockout, mood and lighting.

# Goal
The zombie genre has been a very popular genre over the past few years. Games like Left 4, Dead Dayz and Dying Light, but also series like The Walking Dead or The Last Of Us who recently got a TV series adaptation from their game. But the truth is, there are so many zombie games right now and they are all very similar. So it was our goal to put a unique twist to this genre, offering gameplay that the world of zombies hasn't seen before. At first, we wanted to make a game which offered a mix between stealth and slasher, but we realised that this would be hard to pull off successfully. So eventually we decided to go all in for a slasher game.

# Setting
During our brainstorm, the big question was: How do we differentiate ourselves from other zombie games, how do we create a new experience in this genre? So to solve that question, we started to compare other zombie games. And we quickly came to the realisation that almost all of them are in the same setting. They are usually in this modern age within a city/urban area or in a stereotypical horror setting. One of the thoughts that crossed my mind was, what if we take it back in time? That would not only change the setting but for example the weapons as well. The initial idea was the medieval age, but unfortunately, we found out that there was already a medieval zombie game. So we kept thinking and eventually came up with Ancient Egypt, a super unique setting with lots of possibilities in terms of gameplay, visuals and story. We also decided that a night theme would be perfect for the game, it creates a scary atmosphere using moonlight and torches.

# Story
You might wonder, why Merkhet?


# Gameplay and mechanics
It was clear from the beginning that we wanted to use a typical, old Egyptian weapon in our game. In terms of mechanics and abilities, we thought about a lot of different things, but ultimately, the concept of time was really interesting to us. Additionally, we came up with an interesting mechanic which would motivate the player to slash his way through the game.

## Khopesh

The Khopesh is a typical weapon from Ancient Egypt. So we thought it would be the perfect weapon for the game. It is way more unique than the typical sword or knife that you see in other zombie games. The player uses this to kill the zombies.



## Infection (Decaying Health)
In almost every zombie game, the entire goal is to not get infected. But we decided to change that up, you actually start off infected! This makes his health deplete. Merkhet has to fight against his infection, by killing other zombies and thus fighting against the urge to turn. This makes him regen his health back. We thought this was a really interesting mechanic for a zombie game and it also made sure that the game was fairly fast-phased and made sure that the player kills a lot of zombies, as it is a slasher game.
## Time Stop Dome
The main ability is the time stop dome. Using it creates a stationary dome at the player's position. Inside the dome, time is stopped. This means that all enemies and enemy projectiles are frozen. If the player does an attack, this won't get executed instantly. Instead, he leaves behind a shadow. Once the dome ends, time will resume and all the attacks the player did will be executed. This ability also impacts your health depletion, as the infection will also freeze in time. 
## Time Rewind
The player goes 3 seconds back in time. It teleports him to that position and he goes back to that health, regardless if he lost or gained health during that time period.

## Time Forward
The player shoots a laser, that makes the first zombie hit fast forward in time. This means that his body decays rapidly until he gets turned into dust. If cast during the time stop dome, this is also executed by the shadow when time resumes.
## Dash
As a supportive mechanic, we added a dash. You simply dash forward and it helps the player travel around. Especially during the time stop this is useful, as you can easily dash from one enemy to another to get multi-kills inside the dome. 
# Zombies
At first, we only had melee zombies. But after playtesting, we felt like having a ranged zombie would benefit the game a lot. It adds a lot to the game, especially with the time stop. It is satisfying to see the projectile freeze right in front of you so you can dodge it afterwards. The zombies would be a mix of a zombie with a mummy, to fit the Ancient Egypt setting.
# Level
This is a block out of the level. We wanted to give the illusion of a big city with lots of chaos because of the apocalypse. We did this by blocking off some parts of the streets. The path to the end is very straightforward, the player doesn't have a hard time looking for the path that he has to follow.
# Improvements and what's next
We would like to work this out and polish it more someday when we have more time. Some of the mechanics don't look super exciting yet, for example, the time forward. Right now it is just a simple laser that one-shots, but in the actual game, this would be a very satisfying ability that turns the zombies to dust. Next to that, we would also add some more visuals and animations.

The actual gameplay that we would improve is the combat. We would add some additional attacks with the Khopesh. Currently, it is a simple slash, but we can do so many extra things with this unique weapon. The zombie combat would also change. Currently, you one-shot them, no matter where you hit them. But we would change the amount of hits depending on where you hit them. We could also introduce different types of zombies, with each type having unique health, attacks, range, etc.
