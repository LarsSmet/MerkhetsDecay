# Introduction
Merkhet's Decay is a zombie slayer based in Ancient Egypt. Where you play as the half-god Merkhet, armed with the power of time manipulation he fights againsts hordes whilst the infection slowly spreads over his body.

I made this project with Ruben Verhelst, one of my best friends. My primary focus was on designing and prototyping, while he took charge of the blockout, mood and lighting.

# Goal
The zombie genre has been a very popular genre over the past few years. Games like Left 4, Dead Dayz and Dying Light, but also series like The Walking Dead or The Last Of Us who recently got a TV series adaptation from their game. But the truth is, there are so many zombie games right now and they are all very similar. So it was our goal to put a unique twist to this genre, offering gameplay that the world of zombies hasn't seen before. 

# Setting
During our brainstorm, the big question was: How do we differentiate ourselves from other zombie games, how do we create a new experience in this genre? So to solve that question, we started to compare other zombie games. And we quickly came to the realisation that almost all of them are in the same setting. They are usually in this modern age within a city/urban area or in a stereotypical horror setting. One of the thoughts that crossed my mind was, what if we take it back in time? That would not only change the setting but for example the weapons as well. The initial idea was the medieval age, but unfortunately, we found out that there was already a medieval zombie game. So we kept thinking and eventually came up with Ancient Egypt, a super unique setting with lots of possibilities in terms of gameplay, visuals and story. We also decided that a night theme would be perfect for the game, it creates a scary atmosphere using moonlight and torches.
